Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system has been envisioned as a promising technology to be applied in future applications requiring both communication and high-accuracy sensing. Different from most research focusing on theoretical analysis and optimization in the area of ISAC, we implement a reconfigurable distributed antennas and reflecting surfaces (RDARS)-aided ISAC system prototype to achieve the dual-functionalities with the communication signal. A RDARS, composed of programmable elements capable of switching between reflection mode and connected mode, is introduced to assist in uplink signal transmission and sensing. The developed RDARS-aided ISAC prototype achieves reliable user localization without compromising the communication rate, showcasing its potential for future 6G systems.
